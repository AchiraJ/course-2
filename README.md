# Lab Number 2

The point of this Lab is to get you working with Naive Bayesian Classifiers and to continue on the testing mindset.

# Environment

To get your environment running you will need Python 3.5.x (I've tested both). You will also have to install some packages:

```
pip install bs4 chardet
```

# To run the experiment

To run this experiment I want you to work with crossvalidate.py and naive_bayes/spam_trainer.rb

The goal is to complete the TODO's and to play around with possibilities.

## Suggestion

Shortening the fold1.label and fold2.label files will help increase the speed of crossvalidating.
